# Project
- Predicted movie ratings based on usersâ€™ rating history
- Big data handling (1 million data points)
- Compared basic regression models in R caret as well as deep learning models in R keras
- Discovered data structure to Improve model performance
- The final report is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ot0fehDgJmGsgI7cjJ-O4jLypfUefu0W/view?usp=sharing">here</a>

(Model improvement)
- Explored the capability of deep neural network on this particular regression problem

# Potential model improvement
<a href="https://github.com/kh-w/movielens_rating_prediction/blob/main/deep_neural_network_regression.R">Deep neural network</a>
1) Built a densely connected neural network
2) Achieved a similar RMSE, i.e. 0.8771, compare to the linear regression RMSE 0.8775491.
